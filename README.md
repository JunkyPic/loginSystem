loginSystem
===========

A simple PHP login system using Sessions

This README contains a lot more things than it should. I will SOON modify it.

A few things to note and some TODOs:
   - SOON - Trademark - See this link for clarification - http://www.wowwiki.com/Soon
   - First run the files in the _installation folder!
	  - Modify the credentials in _installation/create_db.php to suit your own. Do the same with _installation/create_tables.php.
      - Run create_db.php then create_tables.php. A more user friendly interface will come. SOON.
   - Some parts of the code are repetitive(not so great, I know) I will change that SOON.
   - TODO: The Recover Password does not work for not. I intend on using SwiftMail to do that. I never got around to setting up a proper SMTP because quite frankly I don't know how to set it up. Issues regarding firewall.
